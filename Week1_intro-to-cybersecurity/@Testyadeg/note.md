# Introduction to cybersecurity on tryhackme.com 

I learnt about offensive security. To outsmart an hacker i must be able to think like one. Offensive CS involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes, in applications to gain unauthorized access. 

## Careers
Penetration tester---- They are responsible for testing technology products for finding exploitable security vulnerabilities

Red teamer---- They play the role of an adversary, attacking organization and providing feedback from an enemy perspectives.

Security engineer---- They maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks.

## Defensive Cybersecurity tryhackme.com

Today, i took a dive into the world of defensive security. Basically defensive cybersecurity is of two main tasks;
[a] Preventing intrusions from occuring
[b] Detecting Intrusions when they occur and responding properly. 
I've also learnt some other task related to the defensive team, which are;
1. Ensuring my cyber security awareness and training others
2. Documenting and managing assets
3. Updating and patching systems
4. Setting up preventive security devices e.g firewalls and IPS {intrusion prevention system}
5. Setting up logging and monitoring devices.

Going deeper, i got to know about other vital areas
# Security Operations Center {SOC} ------ 
They are team of cybersecurity professionals that monitors the network and its system to detect malicious cybersecurity events. some main areas of SOC are:
[a] Vulnerabilities discovery and ensuring necessary measures are taken to prevent attackers from exploiting it.
[b] Policy violations 
[c] Unauthorized activity 
[d] Network intrusions

# Threat Intelligence ------ 
Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries.

# Digital Forensics and incident response {DFIR}
Digital forensics focuses on analysing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators

Incident response refers to a data breach or cyber attack and ways to quickly respond to such threats. We have four major phases of the incident response;
1. Preparation --- Requires a team trained and ready to handle incidents
2. Detection and Analyses
3. Containment, Eradication and Recovery --- The incident is stopped, eliminated and affected systems recover.
4. Post-incident Activity --- A report is produced and lessons learned is shared to prevent similar future incidents.

# Malware Analysis ------
Malware stands for malicious software. It aims to learn about some malware programs like trojan horse, virus, ransomware etc. Thers are two analysis techniques we use;
1. Static analysis --- Inspecting the malicious programs without running it.
2. Dynamic analysis --- works by running the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its activities.

# Search Skills
I learnt how to evaluate information sources, use search engine efficiently, I explored specialized search engines and made use of social media...
There are some certain things to consider when evaluating information;
1. Source ---- identifying the author or organization publishing the information
2. Evidence and reasoning ---- check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning.
3. Objectivity and bias ---- evaluate the info. if presented impartially and rationally.
4. Corroboration and consistency ---- validate the info from other reputable sources

## Search engines
1. Google
2. Bing
3. DuckDuck Go

There are some search operators supported by google, e.g
> "e.p" it indicates you are looking for pages with the exact word or phrase

> site: it lets you specify the domain name to which you want to limit your search

> "-" the minus sign allows you to omit search results that contain a particular word or phrase

> Filetype: indispensable for finding files instead of webpages. e.g Filetype: ppt cybersecurity

We also have some specialized searcg engines...
1. shodan ---- it allows me to search for specific types and versions of servers, networking equipment, industrial control systems, and IoT devices.
2. Censys ---- focuses on internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates, and other internet assets.
3. VirusTotal ---- it provides virus scanning service for files using multiple antivirus engines.
4. HIBP [have i been pwned] ---- it tells you if an email address has appeared in a leaked data breach

I also leant that when protecting an organization, i must ensure that the workers and employees are not oversharing personal and work informations on social media.
