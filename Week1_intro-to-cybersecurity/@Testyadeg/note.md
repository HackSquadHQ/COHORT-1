# Introduction to cybersecurity on tryhackme.com 

I learnt about offensive security. To outsmart an hacker i must be able to think like one. Offensive CS involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes, in applications to gain unauthorized access. 

## Careers
Penetration tester---- They are responsible for testing technology products for finding exploitable security vulnerabilities

Red teamer---- They play the role of an adversary, attacking organization and providing feedback from an enemy perspectives.

Security engineer---- They maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks.

## Defensive Cybersecurity tryhackme.com

Today, i took a dive into the world of defensive security. Basically defensive cybersecurity is of two main tasks;
[a] Preventing intrusions from occuring
[b] Detecting Intrusions when they occur and responding properly. 
I've also learnt some other task related to the defensive team, which are;
1. Ensuring my cyber security awareness and training others
2. Documenting and managing assets
3. Updating and patching systems
4. Setting up preventive security devices e.g firewalls and IPS {intrusion prevention system}
5. Setting up logging and monitoring devices.

Going deeper, i got to know about other vital areas
# Security Operations Center {SOC} ------ 
They are team of cybersecurity professionals that monitors the network and its system to detect malicious cybersecurity events. some main areas of SOC are:
[a] Vulnerabilities discovery and ensuring necessary measures are taken to prevent attackers from exploiting it.
[b] Policy violations 
[c] Unauthorized activity 
[d] Network intrusions

# Threat Intelligence ------ 
Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries.

# Digital Forensics and incident response {DFIR}
Digital forensics focuses on analysing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators

Incident response refers to a data breach or cyber attack and ways to quickly respond to such threats. We have four major phases of the incident response;
1. Preparation --- Requires a team trained and ready to handle incidents
2. Detection and Analyses
3. Containment, Eradication and Recovery --- The incident is stopped, eliminated and affected systems recover.
4. Post-incident Activity --- A report is produced and lessons learned is shared to prevent similar future incidents.

# Malware Analysis ------
Malware stands for malicious software. It aims to learn about some malware programs like trojan horse, virus, ransomware etc. Thers are two analysis techniques we use;
1. Static analysis --- Inspecting the malicious programs without running it.
2. Dynamic analysis --- works by running the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its activities.
