# Networking Fundamentals for Cybersecurity

This week focused on understanding how computer networks work — the backbone of cybersecurity. Knowing how data moves across networks helps identify where threats can occur and how to defend against them.

## Key Concepts Covered

### What is a Network?
A system that connects computers and devices to share data and resources.

### Types of Networks:

LAN (Local Area Network) – small, local connections (e.g., home or office).

WAN (Wide Area Network) – connects LANs over large distances (e.g., the Internet).

### Network Devices:
Routers, switches, firewalls, hubs, and access points — each playing a unique role in data flow and protection.

### IP Addressing:
Understanding IPv4, subnetting, and how devices identify each other on a network.

### Protocols:

TCP/IP – the communication standard of the Internet.

HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, DNS, DHCP, ICMP – core protocols every defender must know.

### Practical Focus

we practiced with Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize network topologies.

Explored Wireshark for packet capturing and analysis.

Learned how to read packet headers and identify basic traffic patterns.

### Reflection

Every cybersecurity attack starts (and ends) in a network. Mastering networking fundamentals means learning to see the invisible understanding how data flows, spotting anomalies, and strengthening digital defenses from the ground up.
