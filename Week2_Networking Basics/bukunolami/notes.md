 NETWORKING BASIS SUMMARY

 Cisco Networking Basics covers the essential concepts and technologies that form the foundation of modern networking. Some key topics include:

Network Fundamentals

1. LAN (Local Area Network): connecting devices within a limited area
2. WAN (Wide Area Network): connecting devices over larger distances
3. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network): wireless networking

TCP/IP Protocol Suite

1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): ensures reliable data transfer
2. IP (Internet Protocol): routes data packets across networks
3. Other key protocols: DNS, DHCP, HTTP, FTP

IP Addressing and Subnetting

1. IP address structure: IPv4 and IPv6
2. Subnetting: dividing networks into smaller segments
3. IP address management: assigning and managing IP addresses

Routing and Switching

1. Routing: forwarding packets between networks
2. Switching: forwarding packets within networks
3. Router and switch configuration: basic setup and troubleshooting

Network Security and Management

1. Network security threats: types and mitigation strategies
2. Firewalls: controlling network access
3. Network management: monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance

Cisco Networking Essentials


I will love to dive deeper on the topic which is Routing and Switching

Routing

Routing is the process of forwarding packets between different networks. A router connects multiple networks and routes traffic between them. Key concepts include:

1. Routing Tables: Routers use routing tables to determine the best path for forwarding packets.
2. Static Routing: Manually configured routes that don't change unless updated.
3. Dynamic Routing: Routes are learned and updated automatically using routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP).

Switching

Switching is the process of forwarding packets within a network. A switch connects devices within a network and forwards traffic to the intended destination. Key concepts include:

1. MAC Address Learning: Switches learn the MAC addresses of devices connected to them.
2. Switching Tables: Switches use switching tables to forward packets to the correct destination.
3. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks): Switches can be configured to create separate VLANs for different departments or groups.

Key Differences

1. Routing: Forwarding packets between networks
2. Switching: Forwarding packets within a network

Cisco Devices

1. Routers: Cisco routers (e.g., ISR, ASR) connect multiple networks and route traffic.
2. Switches: Cisco switches (e.g., Catalyst, Nexus) connect devices within a network and forward traffic.

Real-World Applications

1. Network Design: Understanding routing and switching is crucial for designing efficient and scalable networks.
2. Network Troubleshooting: Knowledge of routing and switching helps troubleshoot connectivity issues and optimize network performance.
