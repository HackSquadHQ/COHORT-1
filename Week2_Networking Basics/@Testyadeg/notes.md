# Hello GitHub Family!

Iâ€™m excited to share another milestone in my learning journey â€” Iâ€™ve successfully completed the Networking Basics course with Cisco Networking Academy.

This course deepened my understanding of how computer networks truly operate, from IP addressing and subnetting to how routers, switches, and network protocols enable smooth communication across systems.

One thing that stood out for me is how every secure system starts with a well-structured and properly configured network. For anyone pursuing cybersecurity, networking knowledge is the foundation that keeps everything connected â€” and protected.

As I continue building my skills, Iâ€™m now moving forward to explore more advanced networking concepts and hands-on security practices.

Letâ€™s connect and learn together! ðŸš€
